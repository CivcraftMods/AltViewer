# AltViewer [![Build Status](http://dydoisbutts.info:8080/job/AltViewer/badge/icon)](http://dydoisbutts.info:8080/job/AltViewer/)

A mod for managing associations in a friendly manner.

Add a command, /lookup <player> to check associations of the specified player.

You can import an alt list from a csv on pastebin. See http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cKTRRx8j as an example (always use raw text, not the direct pastebin link)

In the gui (default key is "U") you can enter any name in the text field (tab to complete) to search for someone's associations. If the person is not associated with any other accounts it will create a new association with that as the main account.

You can also export your alt list as a csv which you can then share with your friends. It will export to .minecraft/AltViewer/tulpas.csv
